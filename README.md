_Mal-Scraper_ is an unofficial PHP API which scraps and parses page source of [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).

Well, it is created to help people get MyAnimeList data without relying on MyAnimeList since they disabled/closed their API. It's working as long as the web is up and we can get its page source.

_Mal-Scraper_ is using [Sunra's](https://github.com/sunra/php-simple-html-dom-parser) HTML DOM parser and inspired by [Kylart's](https://github.com/Kylart/MalScraper) and [Jikan's](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan) API.

### Features
- Get general information of anime, manga, charater (from anime and manga), or people (voice actor, author, staff, etc)
- Get additional information of anime or manga character and staff, statistic and score, or picture
- Get list of anime or manga of selected studio/producer, magazine, or genre
- Get list of all anime or manga genre, anime studio/producer or manga magazine
- Get list of character and staff involved in an anime or manga
- Get result of searching, anime, manga, character, people or user (pagination supported)
- Get seasonal anime
- Get list of top anime from various categories (all, airing, upcoming, etc) (pagination supported)
- Get list of top manga from various categories (all, manga, novel, etc) (pagination supported)
- Get information of user profile, friends, history, and anime/manga list
- Caching (using [Simple-PHP-Cache library](https://github.com/cosenary/Simple-PHP-Cache))
- Convertable return to http response (for API)
- (Bonus) Get all anime/manga cover from user list

_More will be coming soon..._

        )
    [synopsis] => In the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets and moons of the solar system leaving the now uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind. The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as \"Cowboys.\" The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals.
Mellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wong—the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member's dark and mysterious past little by little.
Well-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy, Cowboy Bebop is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after.
