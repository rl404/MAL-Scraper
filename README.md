# MAL-Scraper

> Scrap everything from MyAnimeList website

_Mal-Scraper_ is an unofficial PHP API which scraps and parses page source of [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).

Well, it is created to help people get MyAnimeList data without relying on MyAnimeList since they disabled/closed their API. It's working as long as the web is up and we can get its page source.

_Mal-Scraper_ is using [Sunra's](https://github.com/sunra/php-simple-html-dom-parser) HTML DOM parser and inspired by [Kylart's](https://github.com/Kylart/MalScraper) and  [Jikan's](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan) API.
